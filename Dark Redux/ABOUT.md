# Dark Redux
This theme was created based on Default Redux.
The main difference is the darkening of all (or almost all) of the available UI interfaces.
There are three predominant colors (hex) in the files, and they are #0c0c0c, #232323 and #303030, with some details in #00fff2 (cyan).
Feel free to modify everything! :D
